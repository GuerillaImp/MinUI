Plan:

I really need to plan out my approach to implementing this, as it is currently a massive project, without any real goals or direction


first step should be getting decent modules completed 
healthbar/manabar/powerbar/chargebar/etc

then add these into the unit frame addon


this way all the settings management for configuring the modules will be set and i can work on the config gui
